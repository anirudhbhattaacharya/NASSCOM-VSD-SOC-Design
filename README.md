# Workshop on Digital VLSI SoC Design and Planning

**Digital VLSI SoC Design and Planning**

***A Five-Day Journey in Digital VLSI SoC Design***

This workshop has been an enlightening experience, guiding me through the intricacies of Digital VLSI SoC design using tools like OpenLane. Over the course of five days, I delved into various aspects of chip design, from understanding the fundamentals to executing practical tasks.

## Day 1 - Introduction and OpenLane Invocation  

In todayâ€™s digital age, the significance of chips in electronics is ubiquitous, powering devices ranging from smartphones to computers. In this introductory session, I explored the essence of chip design, understanding the components and processes involved. OpenLane emerged as a pivotal tool, enabling the translation of design concepts into tangible chip layouts.

## Day 2 - Floor Planning Fundamentals  

A solid floor plan lays the foundation for efficient chip design. Through a comparative study of good versus bad floor plans, I grasped the importance of factors like utilization factor and aspect ratio. Practical exercises in floor planning equipped me with the skills to optimize chip layouts for enhanced performance.

## Day 3 - Library Cell Customization  

The ability to customize library cells is crucial for tailoring chip designs to specific requirements. By incorporating a new inverter cell into the library, I gained insights into the intricacies of cell design and integration. Practical exercises in spice simulation and layout design deepened my understanding of library customization.

## Day 4 - Timing Analysis  

Timing analysis is paramount for ensuring the seamless operation of chip designs. Through a series of exercises, I learned how to identify and resolve timing constraints, thereby optimizing chip performance. Practical applications of timing analysis tools provided hands-on experience in addressing timing issues.

## Day 5 - RTL2GDS Using TritonRoute and OpenSTA  

In the final phase of the workshop, I embarked on the journey from RTL to GDS using advanced tools like TritonRoute and OpenSTA. Practical exercises in routing and static timing analysis honed my skills in executing the RTL2GDS flow, paving the way for seamless chip fabrication.

This workshop has been an invaluable learning experience, equipping me with the knowledge and skills to embark on digital VLSI SoC design projects confidently. From conceptualization to implementation, each day of the workshop has been a stepping stone towards mastering the art of chip design.
